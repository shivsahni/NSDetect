## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Support For Python 2.7
- Pandas
- dnspython
```
      pip install pandas dnspython
```

### Reading Suggestions
* If you are unaware of AWS NS Takeover and want to know more about it read [this](https://medium.com/@shivsahni2/aws-ns-takeover-356d2a293bca) Medium story describing the misconfiguration and providing the walkthrough for automated exploitation. 
* If you are already aware of NS Takeover, have a look at [this](https://medium.com/@shivsahni2/nsdetect-a-tool-to-discover-potential-aws-domain-takeovers-fd0ff1a8b68a) Medium story providing the detailed walkthrough on NSDetect.

## Usage
The script takes a file having a list of domains as an input, scans each one of them(skipping duplicates) against this vulnerability and at last reports list of vulnerable domains. For help you can run it with *-h* or *--help* option as shown below:
```
python NSDetect.py  -h
```
The input file can be of the following form:

Once we have done sufficient recon on the target and have prepared the list of domains/subdomains we can provide the list as an input to the tool to scan each domain in the list. The script shows the results in the real-time such that the domains highlighted with red colour are vulnerable domains. We can use *-i* or *--input* option to provide the input file as shown below:
```
python NSDetect.py -i ~/Desktop/temp.csv
```

For the take over of the vulnerable domains, we can use [**NSBrute](https://github.com/shivsahni/NSBrute)**, which requires AWS Programmatic Access:
```
python NSBrute.py -d vulnerabledomain.com -a ThisIsNotMyAccessKey -s ThisIsNotMySecretKet
```

**Note:** While you are doing the POC for NSDetect locally, please keep in mind that [DNS Propagation Issues](https://www.siteground.com/kb/what_is_dns_propagation_and_why_it_takes_so_long/) might lead to unexpected results. You may need to provide  sufficient time for DNS changes to propagate. In case you still observe the problem, feel free to raise an issue, we can **together** fix it!
